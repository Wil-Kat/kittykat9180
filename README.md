- 👋 Hi, I’m Kat
- 👀 I’m interested in website development, creating my own business, and eventually getting hired on as a front-end developer with a company.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything. I am in coding bootcamp where I am learning Javascript, HTML, CSS, JQuery, ReactJS and many others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not a lot right now unless you are patient and like teaching people coding.
- 📫 How to reach me: my business email is valencewebdevelopment@outlook.com
